Trese application is a website with a database which help people to find a job, but the other hand helps companies to find people for their open positions. A person can login as a simple user or as a company if he has a company. It contains 2 parts: one part for companies and another for people. The application structure is MVC and it use database and the CRUD paradigm for it.
For example if you are a simple user you can apply with your CV to a company from app, but you can not edit after that the CV. If you are a company you can add some modifications on the app, because as a company there are any rules for you.

The app can be compared with BestJobs app.
